      <description>It’s common knowledge that Nebraska is a volleyball school. However, could baseball soon be added to that list, as well? It’s looking like the Husker baseball team could make a run for that title this year, as they currently sit at #1 in the Big Ten standings with a record of 18-6.
Right now, there are a lot of questions on Husker fans’ minds. Will Nebraska come away with the 2021 Conference title?</description>

      <description>There is no doubt that Nebraska is a volleyball school. After three visits to the NCAA Championship in the last 5 years, including 2 national championships in 2015 and 2017, it would be insane to argue against that statement. Unsurprisingly, any team playing the Cornhuskers has to step up their game to compete, let alone to make an attempt at getting a +1 in their win column.
In mid-March, Ohio State was the next team to face off against Nebraska with two back-to-back games on the 12th and 13th.</description>
