      <description>There is no doubt that Nebraska is a volleyball school. After three visits to the NCAA Championship in the last 5 years, including 2 national championships, it would be insane to argue against it.

In mid-March, Ohio State was the next team to face off against the Huskers.</description>

      <description>My name is Emma Hastings, and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln double majoring in broadcasting and sports media and communication with a minor in environmental studies. I currently work as an intern for HuskerVision and NaviSavi and as a broadcast production assistant for Nebraska Educational Telecommunications. In the future, I want to work in live production, whether for a network or a team.
This semester, I am in a sports data analytics class.</description>
