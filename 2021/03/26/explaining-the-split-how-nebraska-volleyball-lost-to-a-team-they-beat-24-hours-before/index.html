<p>There is no doubt that Nebraska is a volleyball school. After three visits to the NCAA Championship in the last 5 years, including 2 national championships, it would be insane to argue against it. Resultingly, any team playing the Cornhuskers really has to step up their game to compete, let alone make an attempt at getting a +1 in their win column.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Ohio State was the next team to face off against the Huskers. The teams had two back-to-back games on the 12th and 13th. The Buckeyes were a surprise team in the Big Ten and were walking into Lincoln undefeated. Every fan of Big Ten volleyball knew that this was going to be an insane series - and they were right.</p>
<p>After the weekend was over, Nebraska and Ohio State had split two five-set thrillers, with Nebraska taking the first game on the 12th, and Ohio State taking the second game on the 13th.</p>
<p>So, what did it take for Nebraska to beat the only undefeated team left in the Big Ten? What did Ohio State have to do to rebound off a loss and beat one of the best teams in the nation? That’s what I’ll dive into in this blog post.</p>
<p>First, I’m going to run the necessary libraries for this project, tidyverse, cowplot, waffle, ggrepel, and ggalt. Then, I’ll import two different data sets - one showing individual statistics for each player for each game, and the other showing team statistics from each set of both matches. I found this data on the NCAA’s website here** and here**.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>

<p>Then, just to make things easier later on, I’m going to split each of my data sets up into two separate data frames by game. I’m going to be comparing the teams’ performances in each game, so now I’ll have it handy right when I need it.</p>
<p>I want to figure out what exactly made the difference in these two games. What stat line will explain Nebraska’s advantage in game one and Ohio State’s in game two? Being a volleyball player myself, I think it will be hitting percentage.</p>
<p>Hitting percentage is calculated by subtracting a team’s hitting errors from their kills and dividing that number by the total number of hitting attempts. For all you math people, it looks like this: (kills-hitting errors)/total hitting attempts.</p>
<p>First, I’ll make a line chart showing how Nebraska and Ohio State’s hitting percentages compare by set. I’m also adding annotations along the points on the chart to display the exact set-by-set hitting percentages.</p>
<p>I also want to be able to tell who won each set just by looking at the chart. However, rather than cluttering up the chart with more words and numbers, I’m going to distinguish the winner of each set with a bigger point and each loser with a smaller point. I’m also going to assign this line chart to the variable “line1” for later.</p>
<p>Now let’s it all again, except we’ll do it for game 2. I’ll assign this line chart to the variable “line2”.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m going to use the plot_grid() code to put the line charts together. This way, we’ll be able to compare game 1’s hitting percentages with game 2’s. I also changed the figure height and width just so it’s not to scrunched together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(line1, line2, ncol = 1)</code></pre>

<p>After comparing Nebraska and Ohio State’s hitting percentages from each set of both games, I can see that in every single set, the team with the best hitting percentage wins it, 100% of the time. Basically, in order for a team to win a set, and therefore win the game, they have to eliminate their hitting errors and capitalize on every opportunity they get to terminate the ball and wrack up more kills. Getting kills might be important, but if you’re committing an insane number of errors, you’re giving your opponent free points that they didn’t even have to work for.</p>
<p>Speaking of errors, how much of an effect do they actually have on the outcome of the game? Well, as we saw above, hitting errors do make their presence known in the score. However, there are many different kinds of errors: hitting errors, serving errors, serve receive errors, blocking errors, and digging errors. So, why don’t we check out if the error column alone can predict the outcome of a game?</p>
<p>First, I’m going to isolate Nebraska and Ohio State by game.</p>
<p>Then, I mutated an “ERRORS” column that added up the total number of errors committed by each player (besides digging errors, which weren’t included in the stats).</p>
<p>Next, I summarized a “totalerrors” column that added up the total errors that each team committed for each game.</p>
<p>Then, I created waffle charts for each team visually showing the number of errors they committed.</p>

<p>Finally, I ironed them together to show how Nebraska and Ohio State compared for each game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g1errors &lt;- iron(
  waffle(
  nuerrorsg1, rows = 3, title = &quot;Nebraska&#39;s Errors - Game 1&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 error&quot;, colors = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)
),
waffle(
  osuerrorsg1, rows = 3, title = &quot;Ohio State&#39;s Errors - Game 1&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 error&quot;, colors = c(&quot;maroon&quot;)
))</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>g2errors &lt;- iron(
  waffle(
  nuerrorsg2, rows = 3, title = &quot;Nebraska&#39;s Errors - Game 2&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 error&quot;, colors = c(&quot;red&quot;)
),
waffle(
  osuerrorsg2, rows = 3, title = &quot;Ohio State&#39;s Errors - Game 2&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square = 1 error&quot;, colors = c(&quot;maroon&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)
))</code></pre>

<p>After a single glance at either game one or game two, it’s easy to see that errors were the kicker here. The winner of each game had significantly fewer errors than the loser. This makes complete sense. Not only can hitting percentage and total errors can predict the outcome of a game on their own, but imagine the damage they can do together. If a team is just having an off day - can’t get kills and are shanking passes and missing blocks left and right - it’s a fair statement that they will almost never win. That is, as long as the other team isn’t having an even worse day.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I want to do some comparisons on the individual level. I’m going to do this by comparing each player’s hitting efficiency using bubble charts.</p>
<p>First, I filtered out any player who didn’t have a hitting attempt in each game.</p>
<p>Then, I created a bubble chart for each team for each game and combined them together using plot_grid() again. To show a hitter’s efficiency, I put their kills on the x-axis and their total attempts on the y-axis, and the size of their dot indicates how many hitting errors they committed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(nuep1, osuep1, ncol = 1)</code></pre>
